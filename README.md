### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Compares bike share system usage between three large US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C.  The evaluated bike share data was provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/).

The statistics generated include these areas:
1. Popular times of travel
2. Popular stations and trip
3. Trip duration
4. User info

### Files used
A single Python script, bikeshare.py, is required for execution.  Python package dependencies include NumPy and Pandas.

Three data files are used, one for each US city to be compared: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv.  The data files are not included in the repository and must be obtained independently.

Each of the city datasets include the following data in csv format.
* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type

The Chicago and New York City datasets also include this information.
* Gender
* Birth Year
